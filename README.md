# VBA-challenge
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to refactor a given code to help analyize multiple given stocks. Previous code might have taken longer to excute so the goal here is to create a quicker method to analyzie data. This data was also order then a given message, as a pop, was used to tell how long it took to execute given code.

## Results: 
The code for 2017 ran slightly faster than it did for 2018. Overall the stocks for 2017 did better than it in 2018 as can be seen in the excel file once ran. An example of the code written can be seen in a screenshot in the extenstions attached.

## Summary:
VBA was used to make sense of the various stocks we were given. There were conditions to be met that were then able to give us an output we were looking for.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Troubleshooting on different systems like Mac because formatting is slightly different. 
A disadvantage could be debugging a given code instead of creating one from scratch.
An advantage could be it makes understanding given data simpler.

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Pro -It was easy to apply simple changes and can be changed in the future so it can save time in development.
Con- Testing throughout process to make sure the code is still functioning.
